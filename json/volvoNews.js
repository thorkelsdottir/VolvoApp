bigText: "When the Volvo C70 was first unveiled during the Paris Motor Show on 30 September 1996, it was not only the slender body that was brand new. It was Volvo’s first “proper” coupé since the 1800 model, and the first time Volvo had cooperated with engineering firm TWR on a new car. Furthermore, it was to be built partly using new methods at a newly opened plant in the Swedish town of Uddevalla. At the beginning of the 1990s, Volvo decided to expand its passenger car programme with a coupé and a cabriolet. The two versions would be developed in parallel and built on the technological base of the 850 model. A small project group was formed in early 1994 and Håkan Abrahamsson was appointed project manager. Volvo had limited experience in developing such a characteristically niche product, and they were in quite a rush. They therefore chose to cooperate with the British engineering firm TWR, Tom Walkinshaw Racing, who were already involved with Volvo’s racing team in the BTCC.",

The man responsible for the design was 26 year old Jan Wilsgaard, who went on to become Volvo’s head of design for many years, designing the 140, 240 and 700 series, as well as parts of the 800 series.

In 1950 – only 20 years old – Jan Wilsgaard was hand-picked by Volvo’s new design department, before finishing his design studies in Gothenburg. Previously, Volvo’s engineers had been responsible for design of the cars and CEO Assar Gabrielsson is said to have been in doubt about the need of educated designers. The technical director Gustaf Larson had some trouble remembering the name of the young new designer and just called him “the guy with the long hair”. However, Jan Wilsgaard quickly showed his skills. In 1953 he presented a design proposal for what three years later would become a classic model: the Volvo Amazon. It is still considered to be an iconic design all over the world. The young, longhaired Wilsgaard soon was appointed director of Volvo Design and would over the coming 40 years put his signature on many Volvo models: 140, 1800 ES, 240, 760 and the 850. As long as these cars roll on a road somewhere in the world, the designer heritage of Jan Wilsgaard will live on."

bigText: "Bo Wikås will go on to lead Volvo’s motor sport operation in the 1980s in their success with the 240 Group A, but at this moment his work is to test and verify new Volvo models. Together with the project manager for VESC, Arne Åsberg, he travels around the world to demonstrate Volvo’s experimental safety car. At the end of the 1960s, the debate about car safety became increasingly vocal in a number of places including the USA. The huge number of traffic fatalities became a political issue that put pressure on car manufacturers. Volvo had already demonstrated that it was a pioneer in the field, but now there were a multitude of manufacturers showing off experimental safety cars in attempt to show visions of the future. Volvo therefore needed to build an experimental safety vehicle too in order to defend its role. VESC was born out of Project 1560, which was intended to become a major new model, but was instead cancelled. The bodies that had been build for the P1560 were now put to use as VESC cars. The bodies had already been designed from a safety conscious perspective, but were now equipped with a range of innovative safety solutions. This included headrests that would be activated in a collision, anti-lock brakes, self-donning seat belts and a rear view camera. The camera was the size of a biscuit tin and took up the entire space for the rear registration plate. It would be a long time before much of the technology featured in VESC had got smaller - both physically and in terms of expense - so that it was possible to use it in a production vehicle. But the ideas were there. The pictures from the road outside of Los Angeles would be used in a press release, a brochure and oddly enough also an ash tray. All of this for a car that they never intended to sell even one of! However, the marketing value of the Volvo Experimental Safety Car cannot be underestimated. It helped to reinforce Volvo’s role as a pioneer of safety for many years to come.",

bigText: "It is the autumn of 1966, and the new meets the old. The straight-lined meets the curvy. The unknown meets the familiar. Only ten years separate the launch of the Volvo Amazon and the launch of the 144, but when they stand side-by-side in Slottsskogen Park in Gothenburg it is clear to see that a lot can happen in a decade. When the Amazon was unveiled in 1956, it was quite different from the PV 444. It radiated confidence and an optimistic view of the future with its wealth of chrome, two-tone paintwork, and lavish interior. Ten years later, the pendulum has swung back the other way – functional and unadorned are in fashion. Volvo 144 has glare-free aluminium bumpers with a wide rubber strip. Admittedly, the radiator grille design is reminiscent of the Amazon's two-piece design, and the shoulder under the glass housing is a new interpretation of the Amazon's. But, this hardly makes the cars more alike. The design language of the 144 is controlled, and the straight lines promote both interior space and all-round visibility. Naturally, the picture is arranged. But, we are expected to understand that the owners of the 144 are standing next to the red Amazon. It's hard to know how much to read into the fact that the Amazon owner is wearing a hat, while the 144 owner is bareheaded. But, it is clear to see who is the most fashion conscious. In order for the man behind the wheel of the Amazon to be clearly visible, the left door mirror has probably been removed; a small mark can be seen at the ventilation grille. The 144 is also missing its door mirrors, at least on the right side. In autumn 1966, Amazon is still the best-seller of the Volvo programme. It is also the only choice available for people wanting a two-door body or an estate car since the newcomer is still only available in a four-door model. Amazon is undergoing continuous development. The 1967 model has a new grille and a closed cooling system. It will be manufactured for three more years, giving it a lifespan of 14 years. The 140 series lasted just eight years, but lives on to a great deal in its successor the 240, which is not discontinued until 1993.",
