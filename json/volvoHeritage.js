The engine had a capacity of just over 3 litres and the output was a modest 55 bhp. It was a strong and flexible unit, two properties that characterise the in-line six as a technical design. The PV651 and its successor, the PV652, were both longer and wider than previous Volvo cars. All four wheels were given four-wheel brakes as standard, either mechanically (PV551) or hydraulically (PV652) operated.

details: " In March 1930, Volvo introduced its first 7-seaters, purpose-built taxicabs. These cars, designated TR671-679, differed primarily from the PV651 to PV655 due to their longer wheelbases and fittings. The TR671-674 were based on the PV650-652 cars, while the TR675-679 were closely related to the PV653-655 cars. With the exception of the TR676 (which had a taller body), these cars generally looked like the standard models apart from the fact that they were longer. In addition to the complete cars delivered by Volvo, chassis suitable for special bodies were offered.

Comfortable, quiet and rugged cars for everyday use with reliable engines in traditional style. The 654 de luxe version had a very plush interior, twin spare wheels and a reversing light, and it was available in several colours. The PV655 was the chassis version, suitable for special bodies. The launch in 1935 of the PV658 and PV659 changed the appearance of the car considerably. The radiator sloped slightly backwards and a grille was fitted in front of the radiator. The very special wheel hubcaps also contributed to the new character. A more powerful version of the 6-cylinder engine was another new feature.

The differences lay in certain exterior changes and levels of equipment. Many cars saw wartime service running on producer gas with an output of a mere 50 bhp. In 1936-7, the PV51 (standard) and the PV52 (de luxe) cars were introduced. For the PV53-56 models, the appearance was modified with a new bonnet line and a V-shaped grille. The 55 and 56 were the de luxe versions and the 53/54 were the standard models. The 55/56 featured folding front seats. The pointed nose section was carried over to the successor, the PV60.

The design of the PV800 Series was much enhanced by the daring V-shaped nose and the typical American styling with rounded contours.

The design of the car was relatively old-fashioned, as the American lines had changed drastically during the war. The car became very popular, primarily because of the comfort it offered. Most of the cars were sold during the late 1940s. Volvo's first post-war car, the PV60, was also offered in bare chassis form as the PV61.

The price was very attractive - 4,800 Swedish kronor, the same that the ÖV4, Volvo's first car, cost in 1927. American styling influenced the appearance of the 444. This car was the first Volvo to have a unitary body without a separate frame. It was also equipped with a laminated windscreen, an important new safety innovation. Interest was enormous and the original planned production figure of 8,000 cars became almost 200,000 before the PV444 became the PV544. The 444 was the first small Volvo car and the one that really set car production at Volvo moving.

The principal new feature was the design of the front, which now had a lower profile and headlights set back in the front wings. A new version of the PV830 made its appearance in 1953. It was intended as an exclusive car for large companies to use when transporting important visitors. The main exterior feature that distinguished this version was the colour, maroon metallic or dark blue. The interior included exclusive fabric upholstery. The rear seat had a folding centre armrest and there were textile carpets on the floor. Standard equipment included a radio. As taxis, these cars were regarded as being virtually impossible to wear out and a couple of them were actually used until the 1980s.

Today we can e.g. offer a camping table as an accessory for the V70, XC70 and XC90 models. Already in 1957, however, we were demonstrating our concern for family life. On an even more flexible note, it was possible to convert from caravan to ordinary trailer. The price label showed 2700 SEK in 1957. No caravans seem to have survived, unfortunately!

details: " When Volvo presented an open 2-seater sports car with a body made of fibreglass-reinforced polyester in 1954, it was something of a sensation. However, the car did not go into production until 1956 and, after a great many problems, production was wound up in 1957. By this time, 67 (or perhaps 68) cars had been series-produced. The original idea was that this car would only be for export. A convertible was not regarded as wholly suitable for the Swedish climate. However, in spite of this, most of the cars were sold on the domestic Swedish market. The car was based on standard components, mainly from the Volvo PV444, but it was built on a separate tubular frame. The engine was a developed version of the 4-cylinder, 1.4-litre engine from the PV444. Using twin carburettors, a different camshaft, larger intake valves and higher compression, this engine developed 70 bhp.

The changes were the most extensive since the PV444 had been presented in 1944.The body was given a larger, convex windscreen together with a larger rear window to improve visibility. The interior featured a new dashboard with a padded upper half to improve interior safety. The speedometer was the 'thermometer' type; a red strip showed the speed. The rear seat was remodelled to improve the level of comfort and provide space for an additional person compared to its predecessor, the PV444. In technical terms, this model was also updated. The Volvo PV444 was (apart from in North America) only available with one engine alternative. With the arrival of the PV544, a second version was added. A 4-speed manual gearbox was also made available for the first time. Under the skin, the PV544 was continuously updated.

details: " In 1956, a prototype of a new passenger car from Volvo was presented. The car became known as the Amazon in Sweden and the 121 and 122S on the export market. The designation 122S was used for a version with a more powerful engine. Production began in 1957 and this car was initially regarded as a larger model than the PV444. The fact that the 121/122 S was a 4-door model naturally contributed to this. The styling was modern and this model was the first car from Volvo with a pontoon body. People found the car very attractive. The front was characterised by the two oval air intakes. The rear wings were extended and ended with a hint of a fin, a very popular design feature at the time. The Amazon 121/122 S also had a very high safety level with features including a padded upper half of the dashboard, a laminated windscreen and seatbelt attachments both front and rear. In the autumn of 1961, the P120 models included a number of relatively large changes. The previous 1.6-litre engine was replaced by the B18 with an output of 75 or 90 bhp, a 12-volt electrical system and a new grille, while the 90 bhp model featured disc brakes on the front wheels. The 4-door model of the P120 was produced until the autumn of 1966, when it was replaced by an entirely new car, the Volvo 144.

details: " The P210 was the continuation of the PV445. The model designation was changed in the autumn of 1960, when the car was given the same curved windscreen and new dashboard which had been used in the PV544 since August 1958. The production of chassis for special versions ceased at this time. Over the years, people's interest in building special versions had declined and the cost had skyrocketed at the same time. However, the P210 was still available as a van or a more flexible estate. During the winter of 1962, a major modification was made to the P210. This model was also equipped with the B18 engine developing 75 bhp. The transition to a 12-volt electrical system was another important new feature. The P210 Duett was a car that was sold primarily on the Nordic markets. The last car in this series was built in February 1969.

details: " In September 1961, yet another version based on the 121/122S was presented - a 2-door saloon. This version was an eagerly awaited model, particularly on the Swedish market, as Sweden was a typical market for 2-door cars at that time. Technically speaking, there was no difference between the two models. The doors were naturally longer on the new 2-door model to make it easier to get into the rear seat, and the front seats could, of course, be folded forward for the same reason. The rear side windows could be opened at the rear edge to improve ventilation. The engine programme was originally supposed to follow that of the 4-door model. However, as the 2-door was somewhat lighter, it was also regarded as somewhat more sporty and was therefore used in competitions, both rally driving and motor racing. To enhance the sporty image of the Amazon, the fast and lavishly equipped 123GT version was introduced in 1966, with the same engine as the 1800S sports car. In 1968, another engine version was added to this model - the so-called B20 engine, a 2.0-litre version. Production of the P130 continued until July 2nd 1970. This was the final version of this car family, with a total of 667,323 P130s produced over the years.

details: " Early in 1959, Volvo presented a new sports car, two years after the previous attempt with the Volvo Sport, with a body made of fibreglass-reinforced polyester. The new car became known as the P1800, with later designations being P1800S/1800S and 1800E. This new sports car had Italian styling and production began in 1961. As Volvo did not have the capacity to build the car itself, production during the first years was contracted to England. A company called Pressed Steel made the bodies, while final assembly took place at Jensen. Assembly of the P-1800 S was then transferred to Göteborg and Lundbyverken 1963. Body production too was transferred to Sweden and Olofströmsverken. This was in connection with the 1800 E in 1969. The Volvo P1800 was based on the floor pan of the Volvo 121/122S, but it had a shorter wheel base. The car also had an entirely new 1.8-litre, 4-cylinder engine, which initially developed 100 bhp, later 108, 115 and 120 bhp. Over the years, the car was developed primarily by the introduction of new engine alternatives. In the autumn of 1968, a 2.0-litre engine with an output of 118 bhp was introduced. It was followed in 1969 by a version with fuel injection and an even higher output. Technical Specifications Model: P1800 / 1800 Variants: P 1800 S, 1800 S, 1800 E Produced: 1961 - 1972 Volume: 39414 Body: Coupé 2 2 seater Engine: 4-cylinder, in-line, overhead valves, 1,778 cc, 84.14 x 80 mm, 100 bhp at 5,500 rpm, increased in 1968 to 108 bhp at 5,800 rpm. A 2.0-litre, 1,986 cc ( 88.9 x 80 mm), carburettor version appeared in 1968, followed by a fuel-injection version in 1969, 120 bhp. Transmission: 4-speed manual or 4-speed manual with overdrive or a 3-speed automatic, all with a floor-mounted gear lever. Brakes: Hydraulic, discs at front and drums at rear, later models had discs for all wheels. Dimensions: Overall length 440 cm,wheelbase 245 cm. Misc: This Volvo model became very famous as a result of its role in the films about 'The Saint' in which the hero Simon Templar (Roger Moore) drove the car. "

details: " This model can be described as an estate based on the 121/122S (Amazon). It made its debut at the Stockholm Motor Show in February 1962. This extension of the model range gave Volvo a more extensive programme in one and the same car family than ever before. The P220 had four doors and the tailgate was divided into two parts, one part folded down and the other folded up. This design was inspired by station wagons from the USA. The production of the P220 took place alongside that of the P210 and the P220 became more frequent outside the Nordic markets. This car represented yet another important step towards a more family-oriented estate which was less of an into the commercial vehicle market. In this way, the P220 played an important role for Volvo in its development as leading producer of estate cars.

details: " In August 1966, Volvo presented a new 4-door car called the Volvo 144. It represented the start of an entirely new car series which, until 1974, accounted for Volvo's volume models. The styling of the 144 was truly timeless and this is confirmed by the fact that the car, in further-developed form, was still being sold successfully in the early 1990s. The characteristic features of this car included the large areas of glass and three side windows. The 144 was a very spacious car with a large luggage compartment. The Volvo 144 also included many new safety features. In addition to the body with its energy-absorbing zones front and rear, there was a unique braking system in which each braking circuit handled three wheels. Disc brakes were used on all four wheels. The interior had no protruding parts and there were safety belts for the driver and front-seat passenger. Technical Specifications Model: 144 Produced: 1966 - 1974 Volume: 523808 Body: 4-door saloon.

This model had the same technical design as the 4-door model, apart from the number of doors. The doors were naturally longer and the front backrests could be folded forward to make it easier to get into the rear seat. One major difference when it came to the silhouette of the 142 compared with the 144 was that the 2-door version only had two side windows, while the 144 had three. The price of the Volvo 142 was slightly lower than for the corresponding 4-door model, and the car was also about 40 kg lighter.

details: " At the end of November 1967, Volvo presented the third version, in what was now developing into a complete car family known as the 140 Series, the Volvo 145. The Volvo 145 was a 5-door estate with a rear section that, had a virtually vertical tailgate. Everybody agreed that this was a safe, comfortable and extremely practical and spacious car. The cargo volume was more than 2 cubic metres and the floor of the cargo area was completely flat. This design of the rear section has since become a well-known characteristic of all Volvo estates. The Volvo 145 quickly became an extremely popular estate and played an increasingly important role in the 140 Series. The annual changes were mainly the same as were introduced in parallel on the 2- and 4-door versions. A visible change took place in 1970, when the rearmost side window disappeared in favour of a longer one-piece window behind the rear doors.

details: " In the autumn of 1968 Volvo presented the Volvo 164. It was a development of the Volvo 144 but had a more prestige-oriented position. The principal difference in technical terms was that the Volvo 164 had a 3.0-litre, in-line, 6-cylinder engine under the bonnet. This engine had been developed from the 2.0-litre, 4-cylinder engine that was introduced for the 140 Series at the same time, in 1968. From the beginning, the 164 had two carburettors and it was later also available with fuel injection. This was the first time in 10 years that Volvo was able to offer a 6-cylinder car. The last time had been when the taxis in the 830 Series were built. However, when it came to cars aimed at private buyers, Volvo had not had a 6-cylinder car for almost 20 years, since 1950 when production of the PV60 ceased. As far as the exterior of the 164 was concerned, the front had its own styling. The bonnet was longer, to make room for the larger engine. The shape of the front also imparted greater prestige owing to the large grille. In the interior, the seats were totally different, the materials were more luxurious and leather upholstery could be specified. The Volvo 164 was produced between 1968 and 1975. Most of the cars produced during the last year were sent to the USA.

The 1800ES had a newly designed rear end compared with the previous versions of the 1800. The roofline had been extended and the car had a profile that was more reminiscent of an estate. The 1800ES had increased luggage capacity to provide extra space for golfing or hunting equipment, for example. Under the surface, the technology in the 1800ES was the same as that in the other 1800 models. The new version was produced for two model years, 1972 and 1973. In 1972, both versions were produced simultaneously, but only the 1800ES was produced in 1973. When the last cars were built in 1973 and production was wound up, this was due to the increasingly rigorous safety requirements in the USA, in particular, which would quite simply have been too expensive to comply with.

At the same time, a new 4-cylinder engine series with an overhead camshaft began to be used. The previous 4-cylinder was still offered in basic versions for some time. Two-door cars were still very much in demand, particularly on the Nordic markets, and it was therefore only natural to include a 2-door in the programme. However, as the trend was moving towards 4-door cars, the 242 were taken out of production long before the 244 and 245. Over the years, the Volvo 242 was produced with many different engines and gearboxes. The most spectacular versions were the 242GT introduced in the late 1970´s and the 240 Turbo of the 1980´s marketed in North America, both cars offering spectacular performance and answering in full to the classical proverb 'a wolf in sheep?s clothing'.

details: " The Volvo 262C was introduced at the Geneva Motor Show in 1977. The 262C were a 2-door coupé with four comfortable seats; this was possible as the car had the same wheelbase as the Volvo 264. In addition, it had a different roof line from the 4-door cars on which it was based. The windscreen sloped more sharply and the car had a very wide C-pillar. In the first years, the cars were painted silver and had a black vinyl roof. Later, other exterior colours were offered. The interior was very exclusive and included leather and wood. The car was designed at Volvo in Sweden, but Bertone in Italy produced it.

The car was relatively roomy and also had a good, flexible luggage compartment. From the beginning, the car was only available with a 1.4-litre engine and continuously variable automatic transmission. It was rear-wheel-driven and had its gearbox at the rear next to the differential to guarantee good weight distribution. The rear-wheel suspension was a De Dion system.

This means it shared the sports model's transverse engine and front wheel drive, and of course it reaped the benefits of the 480's excellent handling and road holding. During its model life, the 460 were available with a number of different engines ranging from 1.6 to 2.0 litres. All were 4-cylinder units with a single overhead camshaft, and all were developed from the same engine family.

A 4-cylinder petrol engine or a 6-cylinder turbo-diesel powered the Volvo 940, which resembled the 960. The Volvo 940 also launched a number of new safety features. Together with its luxury sibling the 960, a three-point inertia-reel seat belt was fitted as standard together with an adjustable head restraint in the middle of the rear seat, heralding a world breakthrough for these features. Furthermore, an integrated child seat built into the rear seat's middle armrest could be specified as an option. These and other safety developments gained the model many international accolades, not least among them the 'Prince Michael Road Safety Award' and the 'Autocar & Motor' prize for the best safety features.

The 940 estate almost became as legendary as the predecessor 245/240 estate, not least being the last rear-wheel drive Volvo model (together with the S90/V90 series). The 940 estate was very similar to the 960 estate, but provided comfortable and safe estate car motoring 'for the masses', being the successor to cars like the Duett, the P220 'Amazon Estate car', the 145, the 245/240 Estate and the 740 Estate.

details: " Autumn 1990 saw the launch of the Volvo 960, in time for the 1991 model year. The new Volvo 960 replaced the outgoing Volvo 760, which had been on the market since 1982. The Volvo 960 was powered by an all-new in-line 6-cylinder engine, with a displacement of 3 litres. It was an advanced power unit featuring an aluminium cylinder block and double overhead camshafts allied to 4 valves per cylinder. This engine represented the first stage in an entirely new generation of in-line engines, which eventually extended into the creation of a new series of 5-cylinder and 4-cylinder Volvo engines. For the Volvo 960 a number of new safety features was also unveiled, among them a three-point inertia reel seatbelt and an adjustable head restraint for the middle of the rear seat. Further enhancing the new car's safety profile, an integrated child seat built into the rear seat's middle armrest could be specified as an optional extra. These and other safety developments gained the model considerable international accolade, not least among them the 'Prince Michael Road Safety Award' and the 'Autocar & Motor' prize for the best safety features. For model year 1995, the Volvo 960 underwent a comprehensive redesign. The front was given a new appearance; the chassis was almost totally new, including a further developed version of the multi-link rear suspension with a transversely mounted leaf spring of composite material. A new 2.5 litre version of the 6-cylinder engine supplemented the previous 3-litre version. In 1997, the Volvo S90 replaced the 960 Sedan.

The Volvo 960 Estate carried over the tradition of 6-cylinder estate models in the Volvo programme from the 760. This new 960 Estate was the natural choice for descerning customers who wanted a car offering a unique combination of comfort, safety, ergonomics, space and versatility, a combination much appreciated by drivers and passengers interested in activities like golf, sailing or hunting. Model year 1995 saw the 960 Estate undergo a comprehensive redesign. The face-lift to the front gave a fresh appearance. Under the skin, the chassis was almost completely new, and a 2.5 litre version of the 6-cylinder engine was added to the previous 3-litre. Another important new feature for the Volvo 960 Estate for 1995 was the introduction of the latest generation of advanced individual multi-link rear suspension, adding to comfort and road holding properties. The end for the Volvo 960 Estate came in model year 1997, when the replacement Volvo V90 was introduced.

The four new features were: transverse 5-cylinder engine driving the front wheels, Delta-link rear axle which combined the dynamics and ride comfort of independent suspension with the security of a live rear axle, the SIPS integrated side-impact protection system, and the self-adjusting front seat belt mechanism. The exterior design of the 850 bore a strong Volvo identity, and its 740 and 940 heritage was immediately apparent. Volvo 850 GLT received a tumultuous welcome; seldom has a new car reaped so many awards as the 850. Over the intervening years, the 850 series has been expanded with additional variants, among them turbocharged petrol versions and a direct-injection turbo-diesel. The Volvo 850 was also the first car in the world to offer side-impact airbags, which were introduced in autumn 1994. In model year 1997, the S70 replaced the 850 Sedan car.

The design of the 850 estate showed a rear section with a typical Volvo profile, that is to say an almost vertical tailgate - a practical feature that maximises interior space. The Volvo 850 GLT received a tumultuous welcome; seldom has a new car reaped so many awards as the 850. The estate car version was awarded the prestigious Japanese '1994 Good Design Grand Prize' award. Over the intervening years, the 850 series has expanded with more than just the estate car version. The range includes a wider selection of engines, including turbocharged petrol units and a direct-injection turbo-diesel. When Volvo decided to return to the racetracks in 1994, it did so under the banner of the BTCC, the British Touring Car Championships. The first Volvo to take on the competition was an eye-catching Volvo 850 estate car, a load-lugger and road-burner in one. The Volvo 850 was the first car in the world to offer side-impact airbags, which were introduced into series production in autumn 1994.

During the 1930´s a number of convertibles was built on different Volvo chassis by independent specialist coachbuilders. In 1956 – 57, the famous Volvo Sport (P1900) was produced in a very limited number of 67 specimens, of which most have been preserved to this day. Many were surprised when the C70 Convertible was presented in 1997, as this was by far the most exclusive and expensive car with a Volvo badge until then. However, the C70 Convertible was far from being just beautiful. First and foremost it was an exciting ‘drivers car’ with almost the same roadholding characteristics as the C70 Coupé, and with top speed and acceleration far beyond the figures obtained by most so called ‘sports cars’. Volvo had long hesitated to make an open car for safety reasons. But, thanks to the Volvo ROPS (Roll Over Protection System) innovation, safety was integrated even if the open car should turn upside down, thanks to an automatic roll-over-bar which was activated in the event of an accident. Volvo C70 Convertible was first and foremost intended for the North American market, but the open Volvo soon became popular in several other markets with a climate favouring open cars.

details: " With the C30, Volvo made its debut in the segment for two-door premium cars. The sporty design, with two doors, four individual seats, and a glass tailgate, gave a young and dynamic group of customers 'a Volvo of their own'. The car offered buyers a contemporary look with a proud heritage, as the Volvo C30 displayed clear elements of other classic Volvo models with a sporty pedigree, such as the Volvo 1800 ES. Anyone who recalls the acclaimed Volvo SCC (Safety Concept Car) will recognise the exclusive and convenient glass tailgate. The grille of the C30 had a unique pattern with the enlarged iron mark in the centre. Viewed from the side, the pronounced wheel housings and the sloping roof gave the C30 a fast silhouette that is further enhanced by the markedly boat-shaped side windows. This look was created through the narrowing roof and the wide shoulders. The shoulders at the rear were powerfully rounded and accentuated by both the horseshoe-shaped lighting pattern of the tail lamps and the glass tailgate.   Interior-wise, the C30 offered room for four adults thanks to the two separate seats in the rear, with generous head- and legroom.   Thanks to its small size, the Volvo C30 was very nimble to handle, even in limited space. A very torsionally rigid body, a wide track and a relatively long wheelbase all helped to give the C30 responsive and stable driving characteristics.   The C30 was also a successful race car for Volvo, with the company competing both in the Swedish Touring Car Championship (STCC) and the World Touring Car Championship (WTCC) with a C30 prepared by Volvo Polestar Racing.
